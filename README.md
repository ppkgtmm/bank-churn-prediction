# Churn prediction

## General info
- Repo for storing source code of churn prediction end-to-end machine learning project which involves process from data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, parameter tuning to model inference
- This project is a portfolio project of owner and is not associated with any courses or institutions

## Process
### Exploration
- Includes target, features (numerical and categorical) distribution analysis for each target class as well as correlation analysis
- See [exploration notebook](https://github.com/ppkgtmm/hello-hello/blob/main/exploration.ipynb) for more information

### Preprocessing
- Apache Airflow was used to build data preprocessing pipeline (DAG) containing tasks as illustrated in the image below
